# Project Name: London Bike Sharing Data Analysis

## Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing the London bike sharing dataset obtained from Kaggle, showcasing the end-to-end process of data analysis from data gathering to visualization using Python and Tableau. Through various stages of data manipulation and visualization, the project aims to derive insights and trends from the dataset.

## Project Highlights:
- Utilizes Python's pandas library for data assessment, exploration, and manipulation.
- Demonstrates the use of Tableau for creating dynamic and user-friendly visualizations.
- Covers key aspects of data analysis, including data cleaning, organization, and effective visualization techniques.

## Project Explanation:
The project begins with the gathering of the London bike sharing dataset from Kaggle. Subsequently, the dataset is assessed to understand its structure and quality using Python's pandas library. Through data exploration, patterns, trends, and potential areas of interest within the dataset are identified. Following this, the dataset undergoes manipulation processes to clean and reformat the data, ensuring it is ready for visualization.

In the final stage, Tableau is employed to create interactive and informative visualizations that effectively communicate the insights derived from the dataset. These visualizations are designed to present key findings and trends in a clear and engaging manner, providing valuable insights into the London bike sharing data.
